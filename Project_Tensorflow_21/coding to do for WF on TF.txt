------------------ for WF backtest

settle on model to use for WF prediction (for 4.1)

get / retrieve checkpoint network

make prediction and save in CSV or .mat

write WF routine in for loop

get 5-day moving average of r-squared as metric
	start w/ AC code -- check if correct first (no intercept)

wrtie early stop callback based on 5day-movR2

predict and write CSV file (append new predictions)

------------------ for 
nested ifs for training/selecting weekly models
	(review plots)
	choose another network?
		accept trained network?
			retrain?
				moreEP or start over?

use tesorboard
